# 🧠 Memory Game - Flutter with GetX

This project is part of a **state management comparison series** in Flutter. In this version, the memory game has been refactored to use **GetX** for state management.

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. Explore and understand the **GetX** approach to state management.
2. Compare the simplicity and performance of **GetX** with other methods like:
   - **Vanilla (setState)**
   - **Provider**
   - **MobX**
   - **Riverpod**
   - **Bloc**
   - **Cubit**
3. Share learnings with the Flutter community.
